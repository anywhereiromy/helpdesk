## What is NC Helpdesk?

NC HELPDESK is a command line tool designed to manage our ability to provide assistance to students as well as monitor common areas of problems that students face.

----
## How to use?
1. In the command line type: 

```
npm install -g git+https://github.com/northcoders/helpdesk.git
```

2. Whenever you have a problem in your terminal type ```nchelp```. This will launch the `nchelpdesk` which has a few questions to help prompt your problem solving thinking.

We have tried to keep the questions quick and simple and, as always, your feedback is always appreciated.
